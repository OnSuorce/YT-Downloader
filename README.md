# YT-Downloader
GUI application made in Python3 to download YouTube in both mp4 and mp3 format. Many websites that allowed users to download videos from YouTube have been taken down because of legal issues and now i can't download any video without going through hundreds of ads and pop-ups. I often download content from youtube and this application should speed up the process
